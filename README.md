# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent:30 hours spendt in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __SQL Injection__

Vulnerability #2: _Session Hijacking/Fixation_


## Green

Vulnerability #1: _Username Enumeration__

Vulnerability #2: _Cross Site Scripting_


## Red

Vulnerability #1: _Insecure Direct Object Reference__

Vulnerability #2: _Cross site Forgery_


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
 User enumeration was easy one. It took while to figure out most of the other, especially, session hijacking/fixation. I had to ask friend of mine for hint. Sometimes, the thinking towards the issue was not enough or was limited. Eventhough, I was close enough, something was not working properly and hence the result was not as expected. In such case, I'd work on something else and come back it and start from beginning. Doing so I was able to think different which really heloped to creak this lab down. Thanks!
